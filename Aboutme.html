            I'd describe myself as a dedicated
            person. I work as an Account Services Representative and 
            I'm constantly coming across different situations that require dedication and problem solving. Sometimes
            even coming up with a decision right there and then. The ability to do all this did not come overnight. 
            I've always believed in pushing yourself to the best of your abilities. This is how new skills and knowledge
            are gained. These can later influence creativity, confidence, and power. Not only can this be gained in a 
            work-place, but in your personal life as well. For example, I began learning to roller skate, and it took a lot of 
            bumps and bruises but I finally got the hang of it. It's not always east but
            I love to explore new ideas, and new skills. Which brings up the topic of becoming a Software Engineer.

            I'm eager to learn and continue learning the art of programming. I want to become a 
            Software Engineer because our world as we know it is constantly evolving, and so is our technology. 
            It's inspiring to know that all those changes are due to our high developments in 
            programming. I want to be a part of that change to create, and inovate new ideas. That's how
            we build a better future, because at the end all we are doing is helping the wold interact better
            with each other and our technology. I'm thrilled to have learned and understood the main concept of it all, it's 
            interesting to know that behind every video game, and behind every website there is a building block of code
            carefully styled and put together to create something unique. I don't want my learning to end here,
            I would like to become more knowledgable and proficient with this work of art.
